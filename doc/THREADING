~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Retro uses subroutine threading with inline machine code for
some words. This was chosen primarily due to its simplicity,
but also for historical reasons. (All Retro implementations
since 2001 have been primarily subroutine threaded).

The subroutine threading model compiles code to native machine
code, primarily as a series of calls to other routines.

As an example:

  : foo 1 2 + . ;

This will compile to:

  lit 1
  lit 2
  call +
  call .
  ;

The subroutine threading model allows a lot of opportunity for
optimization. Recent releases of Retro support inline machine
code generation for primitives, so the above example can now
compile to:

  lit 1
  lit 2
  +
  call .
  ;
