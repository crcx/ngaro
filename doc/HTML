This describes the experimental extensions to the JavaScript
implementation of Ngaro.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The JavaScript implementation of the Ngaro VM allows for some
interaction with the browser. By default this is not enabled,
but with a few definitions you can quickly take control of the
VM and browser session by mixing JavaScript into your Forth
code.

: toggle-html ( - ) 1 9998 out wait ;

When invoked, this will toggle the filtering of special characters
by the console driver on and off. (By default the special
characters are filtered. These include < > & and others). When
the filter is off, you can use HTML to format the output in the
console.

: js ( $- ) 2 9998 out wait ;

This is the more powerful of the two. It allows for passing a
Retro string to the JavaScript eval() function. You can pass
any valid JavaScript code and have it run. You can also access
the variables and functions of the Ngaro VM using it.

Something simple to try:

: depth s" alert(sp);" js ;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is planned that these extensions will be merged into the Uki
subproject, which seeks to allow more interactions between the
Retro and JavaScript languages.
