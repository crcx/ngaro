This document is part of my ongoing efforts to document Retro.
It will cover vectored execution of words.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vectors are another important concept in Retro.

Most Forth systems provide a way to define a word which can
have its meaning altered later. Retro goes a step further by
allowing all words defined using : or macro: to be redefined.
Words which can be redefined are called vectors.

Vectors can be replaced by using is, or returned to their
original definition with devector. For instance:

  : foo 23 . ;
  foo
  : bar 99 . ;
  ' bar is foo
  foo
  devector foo
  foo

There are also variations of is and devector which take the
addresses of the words rather than parsing for the word name.
These are :is and :devector.
