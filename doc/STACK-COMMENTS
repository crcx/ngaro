This document provides a brief overview of the stack comments
used in retro.forth.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stack comments in Retro are a compact form, using short codes
in place of actual words. These codes are listed in the next
section.

A typical comment for a word that takes two arguments and
leaves one will look like:

  ( xy-z )

In a few cases, words may consume or leave a variable number
of arguments. In this case, we denote it like:

  ( n-n || n- )

There are two other modifiers in use. Some words have different
compile-time and run-time stack use. We prefix the comment with
C: for compile-time, and R: for run-time actions.

If not specified, the stack comments are for runtime effects.
Words with no C: are assumed to have no stack impact during
compilation.
