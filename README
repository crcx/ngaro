RETRO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a small dialect of Forth. It's minimalistic in nature
and is designed to be fairly easy to learn and customize for
specific needs.

There are two parts to Retro, an executable which provides the
virtual machine, and an image file which contains the actual
Retro language.

The virtual machine includes a minimal image. If it can't
find a retroImage and no other image is specified on the
command line, it will start the minimal image.

An extended image can be built. Look in the bin/library
directory for additional modules and a shell script to help
make building custom images a bit easier. You will need the
C console implementation to use it.

The latest docmentation can be found in the 'doc' directory.
